# FootballAnalysis
In this project I will be exploring different football analysis methods and vizualization.
I've started with making basic plots with Python using different packages E.g numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib using data sourced from FBRef.
The plots that I've made are four scatterplots which depict the MLS their most clinical finishing teams, their most progressive passing teams, the most efficient forwards in the MLS and the best passing midfielders of the MLS.
